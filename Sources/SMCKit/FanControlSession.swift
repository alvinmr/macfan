/// - Control counts as taken *before* the first write, because a write that fails halfway
///   may already have switched a fan to manual.

/// - A failed target write hands every fan back immediately.
/// - Only successful writes count as a heartbeat; a client stuck retrying failed writes
///   must not keep the watchdog away.
/// - The watchdog keeps retrying a hand-back that failed.
