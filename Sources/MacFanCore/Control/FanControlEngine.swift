/// - `mayBeControlling` is set *before* the first write and cleared only after macOS
///   confirms it has the fans back, so no failure path loses the obligation to restore.
/// - A failed hand-back stays visible (`.failed`) and is retried on the next tick.
/// - `suspend()` invalidates any update in flight; an update checks after every `await`,
///   so no target can follow the hand-back.
