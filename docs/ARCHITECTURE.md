# Architecture

MacFan is a Swift package. There is no Xcode project to keep in sync; `scripts/build-app.sh`
assembles the `.app` bundle from the package's products.

## Rules of the road

1. **Reading never needs privileges; writing always goes through the helper.** The app
   process never writes to the SMC.
2. **Decisions are pure.** `CoolingPlanner`, `SpeedGovernor`, `SafetyPolicy`, `FanCurve`,
   `SensorCatalog`, `ActivityTracker` and `BatteryInfo(properties:)` take values and return values. They are
   where the interesting logic lives and they are covered by tests. Keep I/O out of them.
3. **macOS is the safe default.** Every unusual situation — no data, emergency, sleep,
   quit, crash, lost connection — ends with the fans back under macOS control.
4. **The privileged surface stays tiny.** Adding a method to `MacFanHelperProtocol` is a
   security decision. Bump `HelperConstants.protocolVersion` when you change it.

## Modules

### `CPrivateIOKit`
C only. Declares the 80-byte `SMCParamStruct` the AppleSMC user client expects, and the
private `IOHIDEventSystem` functions used to read Apple Silicon temperature sensors.
Private symbols are bound with `__asm` labels so they never collide with IOKit's headers.

### `SMCKit`
- `SMCConnection` — open/close, read, write, key info (cached), key enumeration. Thread-safe.
- `SMCCodec` — `flt `, `fpXY`, `spXY`, `ui8/16/32`, `si8/16` ⇄ `Double`.
- `SMCFanControl` — fan readings; manual mode (`F<n>Md` + `Ftst` on Apple Silicon,
  `FS! ` bitmask on older Intel); target speed; restore.

### `MacFanCore`
- **Models** — `Sensor`, `SensorReading`, `SensorCategory` (+ thresholds), `FanStatus`,
  `BatteryInfo`, `HardwareSnapshot`.
- **Hardware** — `SensorCatalog` (key → name/category rules), `SMCSensorProvider`,
  `HIDSensorProvider`, `CompositeSensorProvider` (HID only fills categories SMC misses),
  `HardwareMonitor` (actor; one call → one `HardwareSnapshot`).
- **Control** — `FanCurve`, `CurvePreset`, `CoolingSettings`, `CoolingPlanner`,
  `SpeedGovernor`, `SafetyPolicy`, `PowerProfiles` (a mode per power source).
- **History** — `RingBuffer`, `HistoryStore` (raw samples for sparklines, 10-second
  averages for the last hour, peaks; memory stays flat however long MacFan runs).
- **Activity** — `ActivityTracker` (pure: process CPU time → per-app CPU %, helpers
  folded into their app) and `ActivityMonitor` (actor; reads `libproc`). The app only
  samples while a view showing the result is on screen.
- **Logging** — `CSVLogger` (actor).

### `MacFanXPC`
`MacFanHelperProtocol` and `HelperConstants` (bundle IDs, Mach service name, watchdog
timeout). If you fork and rename, change these and `Resources/*.plist` together.

### `MacFanHelper`
`HelperService` serializes all SMC access on one queue, validates clients with a
code-signing requirement, and runs the watchdog. `CodeSigningPolicy` derives the
requirement from the helper's own signature.

### `MacFan` (app)
- `App/` — `MacFanApp` (scenes), `AppModel` (the one observable source of truth: polling
  loop, sleep/wake, termination), `ThermalStatus` (numbers → sentence).
- `Services/` — `Preferences`, `HelperManager` (SMAppService + XPC), `FanControlEngine`
  (applies planner decisions), `AlertCenter`.
- `DesignSystem/` — tokens (`Theme`) and shared components. Use these instead of
  literal numbers and colors.
- `Features/` — one folder per screen.

## The tick

Every `refreshInterval` seconds (default 2) `AppModel.tick()`:

1. `HardwareMonitor.snapshot()` reads sensors, fans and (every 30 s) the battery.
2. `HistoryStore.record` appends to the sparklines.
3. `FanControlEngine.update` asks `CoolingPlanner` what to do and sends it to the helper.
   Manual targets are re-sent every tick; that doubles as the helper's heartbeat.
4. `AlertCenter.evaluate` and, if enabled, `CSVLogger.append`.

`AppModel.refreshNow()` cuts the wait short, so mode changes apply immediately.

## Design principles

The interface follows Apple's design guidance:

- **Answer first.** Overview leads with one sentence and what to do about it; detail is
  one level deeper.
- **Respond immediately.** Buttons react on press, numbers roll with
  `.contentTransition(.numericText)` instead of flashing, and the curve redraws on every
  pointer move.
- **Direct manipulation.** Curve points are grabbed where you touch them, resist
  progressively past their limits (rubber-banding), and spring back on release.
- **Springs, not durations.** `Theme.Motion` defines critically damped springs by default;
  a little bounce only where a gesture carried momentum.
- **Never color alone.** Every temperature level also has a symbol and a word.
- **Respect the system.** Reduced Motion swaps movement for cross-fades; system font,
  semantic colors, light and dark mode.
